**Abstraction**
<br>
<br>**Encapsulation**
<br> process of binding data and function together into a single functional unit-variable private
<br><br>**Hierarchy**
<br> 2 types
<br>*Generalization* -> class structure hierarchy (super class) & specialization (sub class)
<br> *Aggregation* -> objecct structure hierarchy "whole-part or a-part-of" relationship
<br><br>**Polymorphism**
<br>taking many forms i.e processing object differently depending on context.
<br>Overloading -> 2 method having same method name, but different input parameters.
<br>Overriding -> derived class is implementing a method of its super class.
<br><br>**Modularity**
<br> divide a program into smaller units
<br><br>**Typing**
<br>type conversion
<br><br>**Persistence**
<br>ability of an object or data to outlive the lifetime of the program that creates, accesses or modifies it.
<br><br><br>
<b>Different class</b>
<br>**Static** - common attributes shared by all the instances of the class.
<br>**Abstract** - no implementations, zero or more abstract methods, cannot be instantiated.
<br>**Interface** - contract for the classes to implement the behavior, all methods are public and abstract.
